        <h3>The Experiment</h3>
        <img  src='/img/experiment.png' width="50" style="margin-left: 20px;margin-bottom: 20px;"alt='participants'/>
        </br>
        In this study, you are tasked with searching for a number of documents in a collection of news articles with fellow users. The experiment has four main parts:
            <ol type="-">
            <li><strong>Pre-questionnaire</strong>: we will ask about your experience searching the Web with other users before.</li>
            <li><strong>Waiting phase</strong>: we will try to find a group of participants, and you will start the next phase (at least 10 minutes). You can play Tetris while you wait.</li>
            <li><strong>Collaborative search phase</strong>: you and your fellow participants will be given three different topics to work together on, and each takes about 15 minutes to complete. </li>

            <li><strong>Post-questionnaire</strong>: we will ask about how was your overall experience with our experiment.
            </ol>
        <p> We have a few important points: </p>
        <ol type="-">
            <li>
                <p>
                Only make use of the interface that we provide. Do not use another web search interface to dry run your queries. 
                Do not switch browser tabsâ€“-after three tab switches we will cancel your participation.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>You can interact with the search results. 
                    A click on a document snippet will open this document in our own document viewer. 
                    We know that this document viewer is not perfect, but please stick with it. 
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>You will search a collection of news articles. These are not the most recent news articles. </p>
            </li>
            <li> 
                <p>
                Keep your queries in line with the information need. 
                For example, please do not issue queries for a prior topic once you have begun the search process for a new topic. Keep the queries you issue (and subsequently select) on point, and relevant to the topic outline provided on the right of the search interface.
                If you begin issuing queries that are totally off topic (e.g. queries on ice skating, Brexit, or anything else you can think of), we will cancel your participation.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li> 
            <p>
            The system will guide you forward to new pages. <b>DO NOT PRESS THE BROWSER BACK BUTTON!</b> This may bring unexpected behaviour and you will not be able to move forward again.
